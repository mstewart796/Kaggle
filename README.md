# Kaggle Projects Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle projects repository! ðŸš€

This is where I showcase my journey through Kaggle competitions and challenges, starting with the classic **Titanic** and **Iris** datasets for beginners. These projects have been an excellent way to apply the skills I gained from the **Machine Learning A-Z course** by SuperDataScience on Udemy, which served as my foundation for tackling these challenges.

### What's Next?

Having recently completed my Computer Science degree, I'm now setting my sights on a post-graduate program in Data Science. With advanced knowledge from my studies and more time to focus on competitions, I plan to dive deeper into Kaggle's diverse datasets and challenges, continuously improving my machine learning expertise.

Stay tuned for updates as I take on more exciting projects!
