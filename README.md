# Kaggle Projects Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle projects repository! ðŸš€

This is where I will showcase my journey through Kaggle competitions and challenges, starting with the classic **Titanic** and **Iris** datasets for beginners. These projects have helped me build a strong foundation in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

### What's Next?

Having recently completed my Computer Science degree, I'm setting my sights on a post-graduate program in Data Science. With advanced knowledge from my studies, I plan to dive deeper into Kaggle's diverse competitions, exploring innovative solutions and sharpening my machine learning skills.

Stay tuned for updates as I tackle more complex datasets and challenges!
